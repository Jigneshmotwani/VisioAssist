<h1>VisioAssist</h1>

VisioAssist is a pair of smart glasses equipped with a cutting-edge camera and OCR technology. It reads and understands the text in the world around the user and converts it real-time into natural, human-like speech. 

It also has the ability for emergency contacts to access a live feed from the user's glasses using an app, providing a real-time perspective of the blind person's surroundings. Whether they're lost, need navigation assistance, or simply seek a friendly face, VisioAssist connects them instantly.
